Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Respected (Sir/madam),

With due regard, I want to notify you that my child (name of the student) is a student of class (class name), of your school. Due to some wellness issues, my boy/girl is hospitalized and is recommended to be in a doctorâ€™s monitoring for two days. My family members are taking care of him/her in hospital, right now and we are not in a state to send him/her to school.

Hence, I beg you to please understand our position and grant my child leave for (mention number of days) from (start date) to (end-date). I am inserting a medical document from the doctor for your reference. I ensure you that he/she will attend the school daily going forward.

Thanking you,

Yours sincerely,
(Name of the Parent/Guardian)
